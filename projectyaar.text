Overview 
Routing is a process of sending data packet from network to another network. Data is routed from its source to its destination through a series of routers, and across multiple networks. 
In this paper i am going to configure open shortest path first (OSPF), and OSPF authentication, border gateway protocol (BGP), and BGP authentication by using GNS3 emulator..
I going to start by setting a network topology, assigning IP addresses to the router’s interfaces, enabling routing protocols to the specific topology, providing different types of authentication to specified routing protocols, and verification of each configuration in the routers.
The definition of the keywords which is used in the paper:
Interface  fa0/0: interface is a predefined command and fa0/0 is the interface of the router which is connected to local area network. By using this command we can go into an interface and provide IP address to the interface.
IP address: using this command we can define the ip address of the router interface and we can give the subnet mask to the specific IP address. It is (20.20.20.1) the IP address, and it is (255.0.0.0) the subnet mask which specifies the network portion of the IP address.

Configure terminal:  by using this command we can go to configuration terminal interface of the router and configure the router, without going to this interface we cannot configure the router.
Network: this command is used to specify the networks that the router is connected. It can be either LAN network or serial interface.
No shut:  this command is used to enable the router’s interface; by default all the interfaces of routers are disabled.

What is an autonomous system number?
Within the Internet, an autonomous system (AS) is a collection of connected Internet Protocol (IP) routing prefixes under the control of one or more network operators on behalf of a single administrative entity or domain that presents a common, clearly defined routing policy to the Internet.
No auto-summary: By default routing protocol like RIP and EIGRP summarize subnets into major class full network at class full boundary. In other word, these protocols perform an auto-summarization each time they crosses a border between two different major networks. To disable this behavior and advertise subnets, 'no auto-summary' command is used. Let's say router has two subnets 192.168.10.0/24 and 172.16.4.0/24 of Class B network and one subnet 10.2.0.0/16 of Class A. When auto-summary is enabled, router will advertise only summarized major class full network 172.16.0.0/16 for class B addresses into its Class A interface

Open shortest path first (OSPF)
The Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) protocol is a link state protocol that handles routing for IP traffic. Its newest implementation, version 2, which is explained in RFC 2328, is an open standard. Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) is an open standard (not proprietary) and it will run on most routers independent of make. Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) uses the Shortest Path First (SPF) algorithm, developed by Dijkstra, to provide a loop-free topology. Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) provides fast convergence with triggered, incremental updates via Link State Advertisements (LSAs). Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) is a classless protocol and allows for a hierarchical design with VLSM and route summarization.
Objective:  our aim is to configure OSPF routing protocol using multiple area, and provide authentication on interfaces of router. 
For configuring multiple area OSPF, we should have area zero, and it should act as transaction between other areas. Data packet should be transferred between different other areas through area zero.
OSPF Configuring Multi-Area:

 
Objective 
In this lab we show how to configure OSPF routing protocol with multi area.
Step 1: assign IP address to the interfaces of routers.
For assigning ip address we follow same process as we did in RIP V2
 Assign IP address to router one (R1)
configure terminal
interface fa0/0
ip add 192.168.8.1 255.255.255.0
no shut
exit
int s1/0
ip add 192.168.10.2 255.255.255.0
R1(config-if)#no shut
R1(config-if)#exit

Assign IP address to the router 2 (R2)
configure terminal
interface s1/0
ip address 192.168.10.1 255.255.255.0
no shut
exit
interface s1/1
ip add 192.168.20.1 255.255.255.0
no shut
exit

Assign IP address to the router 3 (R3)
configure terminal
interface s2/0
ip address 192.168.20.2 255.255.255.0
no shut
exit
interface s2/1
add 192.168.30.1 255.255.255.0
no shut
exit

Assign IP address to the router 4 (R4)
configure terminal
int fa0/0
ip add 192.168.40.1 255.255.255.0
no shut
exit
int s1/0
ip add 192.168.30.2 255.255.255.0
no shut
exit
Exit: this command is used for going one step back to the previous interface.
Step 2: configuring OSPF routing protocol on router one 
Assign router one’s interfaces in area 10
configure terminal
router ospf 10
network 192.168.8.0 0.0.0.255 area 10
network 192.168.10.0 0.0.0.255 area 10
exit
Router ospf 10: this command is used to specify the type of dynamic routing protocol is  use and the autonomous system number (10).
network 192.168.8.0 0.0.0.255 area 10: network is predefined keyword, used to define the  network address which we use. 192.168.8.0 This is the network address which is directly connected to our router, 0.0.0.255 this is the mask address which identifies the network portion and host portion of the network address. area 10 : this keyword is used to provide the area number in which our outer is belong.
What is area?
An OSPF network can be divided into sub-domains called areas. An area is a logical collection of OSPF networks, routers, and links that have the same area identification. A router within an area must maintain a topological database for the area to which it belongs.
network 192.168.8.0 0.0.0.255 area 10: this command is used to identify the network address and subnet mask. It also provide the area, it tells the current network is in part of area 10.

configuring OSPF routing protocol on router two(R2)
assign the router interfaces  s1/0 network (192.168.10.0) to area 10 and assign the router interface se1/1 to area zero
configure terminal 
router ospf 20
network 192.168.2.0 0.0.0.255 area 0
network 192.168.10.0 0.0.0.255 area 10
exit
configuring OSPF routing protocol on router three(R3)
assign the router interfaces  s2/0 network (192.168.20.0) to area zero  and assign the router interface se2/1 to area 20
configure terminal
router ospf  30
network 192.168.2.0 0.0.0.255 area 0
network 192.168.30.0 0.0.0.255 area 10
exit
configuring OSPF routing protocol on router four(R4)
Assign router one’s interfaces in area 20
configure terminal
router ospf  40
network 192.168.3.0 0.0.0.255 area 20
network 192.168.40.0 0.0.0.255 area 20
exit
For verifying OSPF routes
show ip route
Or 
show ip protocol
This command is used to show the type of configured routing protocol from flush memory
show ip ospf database
This command is used to show the complete database of router about the networks, it gives the complete routes which exist in the network.
R1#show ip ospf neighbor
This command is used to show the directly connected neighbors from flush memory.
Note: area zero should be backbone it means all other areas should be connected to area zero and area 0 should be as transit.

Configuring OSPF Authentication

OSPF authentication comes in two forms: plain-text and MD5. Because a secure method was specified, we have to use MD5 authentication in our environment (plain-text is not secure).
We configure clear text authentication and message digest five on this topology:
 

Configurations for Plain Text Authentication
Plain text authentication is used when devices within an area cannot support the more secure MD5 authentication. Plain text authentication leaves the internetwork vulnerable to a "sniffer attack," in which packets are captured by a protocol analyzer and the passwords can be read. However, it is useful when you perform OSPF reconfiguration, rather than for security. For example, separate passwords can be used on older and newer OSPF routers that share a common broadcast network to prevent them from talking to each other. Plain text authentication passwords do not have to be the same throughout an area, but they must be the same between neighbors.
For configuring plain text authentication we should follow the following process:
Step 1: assign IP address to the interfaces of routers
Step 2: configure OSPF routing protocol on each router
Step3: configure clear text authentication
Step 1: assign IP address to the interfaces of router one (R1)
interface se1/0
ip address 10.10.10.1 255.0.0.0
no shut
interface f0/0
ip address 20.20.20.1 255.0.0.0
no shut
Step 2: configure OSPF routing protocol on each router
router ospf 10
network 10.0.0.0 0.255.255.255 a 0
network 20.0.0.0 0.255.255.255 a 0
exit
Step3: configure clear text authentication
interface se1/0
ip ospf authentication
ip ospf authentication-key cisco123
exit

Authentication on router two (R2)
Step 1: assign IP address to the interfaces of routers
int se1/0
ip add 10.10.10.2 255.0.0.0
no shut
interface f0/0
ip add 30.30.30.1  255.0.0.0
no shut
Step 2: configure OSPF routing protocol on R2
router ospf 10
network 10.0.0.0 0.255.255.255 a 0
network 30.0.0.0 0.255.255.255 a 0
exit
Step3: configure clear text authentication
interface se1/0
ip ospf authentication
ip ospf authentication-key cisco123
exit
Exit: it is used to go one step back to the configuration
ip ospf authentication-key cisco123: in this command, ip ospf  is used to say that, it is using ospf routing protocol for authentication, authentication-key  it is a predetermined command and used for configure authentication in ospf routing protocol, and cisco123  is the actual password for authentication, it is user defined password, it means you can give any kind of password according to your wish.

Message digest 5 authentication
When you use MD5 OSPF authentication, a key and a key id must be configured on routers. From this key and key id a hash is generated, which is added to OSPF packet header.
This authentication does encrypts the password, so, hackers cannot easily hack the password.it is very secure as compare to plain text authentication.
We work on the same topology which we did for clear text authentication
Step 1: assign IP address to each interfaces of router
Step 2: configure OSPF on each router
We did these two steps in above clear text authentication. We need to configure MD5 only on each interface of routers
Now configure MD5 on router one (R1)
int se1/0
ip ospf ip ospf authentication message-digest
ip ospf message-digest-key 2 md5 cisco123
exit
Now configure MD5 on router two (R2)
ip ospf authentication message-digest
ip ospf message-digest-key 2 md5 cisco123
exit
ip ospf ip ospf authentication message-digest: this command is used to configure MD5 authentication on the interface. Here we specify the type of routing protocol which is OSPF and the mode of authentication, which is message-digest (MD5).

Border gateway routing protocol (BGP)
BGP is an open standard protocol, means all manufacture routers support BGP. It is used to connect and make communication between two different autonomous system number, it grantees loop free routing protocol. It supports VLSM, FLSM, CIDR IP addressing. Updates are incremental as OSPF and EIGRP.
We are going to configure BGP on the following topology.
 

Objectives: configuring neighbors, assigning ip address to the each interface, defining network addresses, and providing authentication.
Step 1: assigning IP address to the interfaces of each router.
Assign IP address to R1
Interface  se1/0
  ip address 1.1.1.1 255.0.0.0
  no shutdown
  interface se1/1
  ip address 4.4.4.2 255.0.0.0
  no shut
  Assign IP address to R2
int fa0/0
    ip add 20.1.1.1 255.0.0.0
    no shut
    int se1/0
    ip add 1.1.1.2 255.0.0.0
    no shut
    int se1/1
    ip add 2.2.2.1 255.0.0.0
    no shut

Assign IP address to R3 

int fa0/0
    ip add 30.1.1.1 255.0.0.0
    no shut
    int se1/0
    ip add 2.2.2.2 255.0.0.0
    no shut
    int se1/1
    ip add 3.3.3.1 255.0.0.0
    no shut
Assign IP address to R4
int fa0/0
    ip add 40.1.1.1 255.0.0.0
    no shut
    int se1/0
    ip add 3.3.3.2 255.0.0.0
    no shut
    interface se1/1
    ip add 4.4.4.1 255.0.0.0
    no shut
Step 2: configuring BGP routing protocol 
R1:
router bgp 500
  neighbor 1.1.1.2 remote-as 500
  neighbor 4.4.4.1 remote-as 500
  neighbor  2.2.2.2 remote-as 500
 network 10.0.0.0
  network 1.0.0.0
  network 4.0.0.0
end
copy run start
router bgp 500: using this command we can defined the type routing protocol we use in outer network and the autonomous system number. And autonomous system is a collection of routers under a single administrative domain.
  Neighbor 1.1.1.2 remote-as 500:  this command defines the neighbor address in which it is directly connected, and the autonomous number the neighbor is belong to.
Network: this command identifies the networks or links in which the router itself is connected.
  R2:
  router bgp 500
    neighbor 1.1.1.1 remote-as 500
    neighbor 2.2.2.2 remote-as 500
    neighbor  3.3.3.2 remote-as 500
    network 20.0.0.0
    network 1.0.0.0
    network 2.0.0.0
R3:
router bgp 500
    neighbor 3.3.3.2 remote-as 500
    neighbor 2.2.2.1 remote-as 500
    neighbor  1.1.1.1 remote-as 500

    net 30.0.0.0
    net 2.0.0.0
    net 3.0.0.0
R4:
 router bgp 500
  neighbor 3.3.3.1 remote-as 500
  neighbor 4.4.4.2 remote-as 500
    neighbor 2.2.2.1 remote-as 500
 net 40.0.0.0
  net 4.0.0.0
  net 3.0.0.0
  end
 copy run start
copy run start : this command is used to store the configurations from RAM to non-volatile RAM.


Configuring authentication in bgp network
BGP supports only MD5 authentication, the concept is same as OSPF, EIGRP, and RIP.
Steps to be followed for configuring MD5
Step 1: assign IP address
Step 2: configure BGP routing protocol
We did the two steps in above section (BGP configuration)
Step 3: implement MD5
Configuring MD5 on R1
R1
   router bgp 500
  neighbor 1.1.1.2
  neighbor 1.1.1.2 password cisco123
  neighbor 2.2.2.2 password cisco123
  neighbor 4.4.4.1  password cisco123
  end
copy run start
Configuring MD5 on R2
    router bgp 500
    neighbor 1.1.1.1 password cisco123
    neighbor 2.2.2.2 password cisco123
    neighbor 3.3.3.2  password cisco123
    end
   copy run start
Configuring MD5 on R3

 router bgp 500
    neighbor 1.1.1.1 password cisco123
    neighbor 2.2.2.1 password cisco123
    neighbor 3.3.3.2  password cisco123
    end
copy run start
Configuring MD5 on R4

 router bgp 500
    neighbor 4.4.4.2 password cisco123
    neighbor 2.2.2.1 password cisco123
    neighbor 3.3.3.1  password cisco123
    end
copy run start
password cisco123:  here the password  is predefined keyword which is used to provide password for authentication, cisco123 is the real password
